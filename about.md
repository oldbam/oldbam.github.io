![Rostik Slipetskyy profile picture](/images/profile-picture.jpg) Hi! My name is Rostik (officially it is written as Rostyslav). I obtained my joint program Master's degree from Norwegian Univeristy of Science and Technology and Technical University of Denmark (NordSecMob Erasmus Mundus Program in Security and Mobile Computing). For the last 5 years I have been working in various Engineering roles at Microsoft. Areas that interesting me most in Software Engineering are flexible architecture/design, writing maintainable and testable code, and, of course, Software Security.
